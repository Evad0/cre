      description: "KEDA allows for fine-grained autoscaling (including to/from zero) for event driven Kubernetes workloads. KEDA serves as a Kubernetes Metrics Server and allows users to define autoscaling rules using a dedicated Kubernetes custom resource definition. \nThere is a known issue with the KEDA operator where the scalers cache from the ScaledObject controller is not being properly initialized. This can cause the KEDA operator to crash.\n"
