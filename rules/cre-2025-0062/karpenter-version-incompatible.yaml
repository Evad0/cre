    title: Karpenter Version Incompatible with Kubernetes Version
    category: incompatibility-problem
    author: Prequel
    description: |
      - Karpenter logs an error when its current version is not compatible with the running Kubernetes control plane version.
      - This results in provisioning failures and indicates a required upgrade to align compatibility.
      - The issue is surfaced via structured logs from the controller.
    cause: |
      - Karpenter performs a runtime check against the Kubernetes API server version.
      - If the cluster is running a newer version than Karpenter supports, the controller will reject provisioning requests.

    mitigation: |
      - Upgrade Karpenter to a version that supports the running Kubernetes version.
      - Review the Karpenter release notes and compatibility matrix prior to cluster upgrades.
      - Consider pinning cluster upgrades behind workload compatibility checks.
