    title: Celery Worker Stops Consuming Tasks After Redis Restart
    category: task-management-problem
    author: Prequel
    description: |
      - When Redis is restarted, Celery workers using Redis as a broker may stop consuming tasks without exiting or logging a fatal error.
      - Although Celery Beat continues to publish tasks successfully, the worker remains in a broken state until manually restarted.
      - This results in a silent backlog of scheduled but unprocessed tasks.
    cause: |
      - After Redis restarts, open connections from the Celery worker are closed by the server.
      - The Celery worker does not detect or recover from the dropped connection, entering a non‑responsive state.
      - This issue is caused by a bug in Kombu (Celery's messaging library) affecting connection recovery.

    mitigation: |
      - Monitor Redis availability and trigger Celery worker restarts automatically when Redis restarts.
      - Consider using process managers like `supervisord`, `systemd`, or Kubernetes liveness probes to enforce recovery.
      - Upgrade to Celery 5.4.0 or later, which includes Kombu 5.4.0 where the issue is fixed.
      - If upgrading is not possible, implement monitoring for task queue depth and alert on worker stalls.
