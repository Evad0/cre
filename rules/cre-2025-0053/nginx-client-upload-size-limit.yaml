    title: NGINX Client Upload Size Limit Exceeded
    category: web-server-problems
    author: Prequel
    description: |
        NGINX server is receiving upload requests with bodies that exceed the configured size limits.
        This occurs when clients attempt to send files or data that are larger than what the server is
        configured to accept.
    cause: |
        The client is attempting to upload a file or send data that exceeds the NGINX 'client_max_body_size'
        configuration limit. By default, this limit is set to 1MB, but can be adjusted in the NGINX
        configuration.
    tags:
        - nginx
        - upload-limits
        - configuration
    mitigation: |
        - Increase the 'client_max_body_size' setting in the NGINX configuration to accommodate
          legitimate large uploads if appropriate
        - Add clear error messages to inform users about file size limitations
        - Implement frontend validations to prevent oversized upload attempts
        - Consider implementing chunked uploads for handling large files

    applications:
        - name: nginx
          version: ">=1.0"
    impact: |
        - Failed uploads and POST requests for legitimate users
        - Increased error rates in application logs
        - Potential for client frustration if no clear error message is provided
        - Possible resource utilization as NGINX has to handle and reject these requests
