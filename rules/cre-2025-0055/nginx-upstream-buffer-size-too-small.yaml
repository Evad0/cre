    title: Nginx upstream buffer size too small
    category: web-server-problem
    author: Prequel
    description: |
        Nginx reports that an upstream server is sending headers that exceed the configured buffer size limits.
        This typically happens when the upstream application sends responses with large headers, cookies, or other
        header fields that don't fit in the default buffer allocation. When this occurs, Nginx cannot properly
        proxy the response to clients, resulting in HTTP errors.
    cause: |
        - Upstream server sending responses with unusually large headers or cookies
        - Default or configured proxy buffer sizes are too small for the application needs
        - API responses containing large authentication tokens in headers
        - Applications setting many or large cookies in responses
        - Session data being inappropriately stored in cookies or headers instead of server-side storage

        - buffer
    mitigation: |
        - Increase the proxy_buffer_size and proxy_buffers settings in the nginx configuration:
          proxy_buffer_size 16k;
          proxy_buffers 4 16k;
        - For very large headers, you may need to adjust to even higher values
        - Add the configuration either in the http, server, or location context depending on where it's needed
        - After changing configuration values, test and reload nginx:
          nginx -t && nginx -s reload
        - Long term: Review upstream applications to determine if header/cookie size can be reduced
        - Consider using server-side session storage instead of large cookies
        - If using JWT tokens in headers, evaluate if they can be made smaller

    impact: |
        - Clients receive HTTP 502 Bad Gateway errors instead of the intended response
        - Critical API requests may fail, breaking dependent applications and services
        - User sessions may be terminated unexpectedly during normal usage
        - Degraded user experience due to intermittent failures
        - Increased error rates in monitoring systems
        - Potential loss of business functionality and customer trust
