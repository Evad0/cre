    title: Terraform Cloud Authentication Failure
    category: provisioning-problem
    author: Prequel
    description: |
      - This error occurs when Terraform Cloud authentication fails due to missing or invalid API tokens, workspace or organization misconfiguration, or insufficient permissions.
    cause: |
      - API Token Missing or Invalid: The workspace might be missing the TERRAFORM_CLOUD_TOKEN or it's using a token that doesn't have access to the right organization or workspace.
      - Wrong Organization or Workspace Name: If your Terraform CLI or backend config points to a workspace or org that doesn't exist or isn't accessible with your current credentials.
      - Permissions Issue: The token you're using might be from a user that doesn't have access to the specific workspace in Terraform Cloud.

    mitigation: |
      - Set the TERRAFORM_CLOUD_TOKEN environment variable.
      - Doubleâ€‘check your backend config.
      - Verify connectivity via the CLI.
      - Check user access in Terraform Cloud: Go to your organization's settings > teams > permissions.
