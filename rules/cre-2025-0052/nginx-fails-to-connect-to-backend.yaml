    title: Nginx fails to connect to upstream backend service
    category: web-server-problems
    author: Prequel
    description: |
        Nginx is unable to establish a connection to the configured backend/upstream service. This occurs when the backend service is not running, not listening on the expected port, or there are network connectivity issues between Nginx and the backend.
    cause: |
        The backend service may be down, crashed, or not started.
        The upstream configuration in Nginx may have incorrect host or port settings.
        Network or firewall rules may be blocking connections between Nginx and the backend.
        The backend service may be overloaded and not accepting new connections.

        - connection-refused
    mitigation: |
        1. Verify the backend service is running: `systemctl status <service-name>`
        2. Check the Nginx upstream configuration to ensure correct host and port
        3. Validate network connectivity: `curl` or `telnet` to the backend from the Nginx host
        4. Check firewall rules: `iptables -L` or `ufw status`
        5. Inspect backend service logs for errors that might prevent it from accepting connections

    applications:
        - name: nginx
          version: ">= 1.x"
    impact: |
        Client requests to the affected paths will fail with 502 Bad Gateway errors. This can cause complete unavailability of the application or API endpoints that rely on the unreachable backend service.
