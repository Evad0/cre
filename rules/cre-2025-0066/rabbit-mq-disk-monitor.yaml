    title: RabbitMQ disk monitor fails to initialize
    category: message-queue-problem
    author: Prequel
    description: |
      - RabbitMQ’s disk monitor process cannot start or retrieve free‐space metrics, preventing it from detecting low‐disk conditions.
    cause: |
      - The disk monitoring plugin fails to initialize, often due to missing permissions, misconfigured file paths, or an unsupported operating system environment.
    tags:
      - rabbitmq
      - disk-monitor
      - monitoring
      - plugin
    mitigation: |
      - Ensure the RabbitMQ process has read access to the directories it must monitor (e.g., the data and log file paths).
      - Verify that the `disk_free_limit` and related configuration keys are correctly set in `rabbitmq.conf`.
      - Upgrade to a RabbitMQ version where disk‑monitor initialization issues are fixed.
