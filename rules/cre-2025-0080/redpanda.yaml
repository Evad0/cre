      description: >
        Detects when a Redpanda node becomes isolated (heartbeats fail)
        and triggers a Raft re-election, indicating quorum loss.
      impact: >
        Without a quorum, the cluster cannot commit new writes,
        causing topic availability to drop to zero until a new leader is chosen.
      cause: >
        One or more replicas become unavailable (e.g., crashed, network-partitioned),
        so heartbeats to that node timeout and the remaining nodes start a Raft election. 
      mitigation: >
        **Immediate Actions:**
          1. Reconnect or restart the isolated node:
             ```bash
             docker start redpanda2
             ```
          2. Check Redpanda logs to confirm it rejoins the Raft cluster:
             ```bash
             docker logs redpanda2 --tail 20
             ```
          3. Verify leadership status with:
             ```bash
             rpk cluster show
             ```
        **Long-term Fixes:**
          - Ensure minimum 3 voting replicas for quorum.
          - Monitor inter-broker network latency and packet loss.
          - Deploy Redpanda behind a stable DNS or static IPs.
